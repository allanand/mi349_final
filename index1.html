            <p class="plz">Here is a fully functional 3D printed phone holder that I created using the platform Tinkercad. It was made using resin and was printed in 2 separate parts (purple and orange parts). It has space in the front or back to support power cords or auxiliary cables.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="plz">Here is a laser printed clock I created themed after the Playstation 4 controller using Adobe Photoshop. I ended up using wood so the Playstation symbols would stand out more. It can be hung on the wall by using the hook on the top and there is battery powering it from the back.</p>
